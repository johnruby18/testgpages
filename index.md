title: Spotify Playlist Data

## Project Statement and Motivation

Spotify often creates playlists for the benefit of its users. Users can show interest in and support for a playlist by "following" the playlist, ensuring easy access to the playlist in the User Interface, as well as updates of playlist developments. Determining the sucess of a playlist (based on number of followers) is certainly of interest to Spotify, as they strive to deliver a quality product to thier users, as well as an interesting modeling project.

We noticed in our EDA that playlists tend to fall into two buckets at around the 25th percentile of followers. Therefore, we decided to treat this as a classification problem of determining successful and unsuccesful playlists based on this ad-hoc cutoff.

## Intro and Data Description

All of our data comes from the Spotify API.

We acquired just under 1,595 official Spotify-generated non-user playlists and extracted 41 features as follows:

* 'id'
* 'name'
* 'followers' 
* 'collab'
* 'num_tracks'
* 'mean_time'
* 'std_time'
* 'total_explicit'
* 'mean_popularity'
* 'std_popularity'
* 'max_popularity'
* 'mean_artists_count'
* 'std_artists_count'
* 'user'
* 'mean_acousticness'
* 'std_acousticness'
* 'mean_danceability'
* 'std_danceability'
* 'mean_energy'
* 'std_energy'
* 'mean_instrumentalness'
* 'std_instrumentalness'
* 'mean_liveness'
* 'std_liveness'
* 'mean_loudness'
* 'std_loudness'
* 'mean_mode'
* 'std_mode'
* 'mean_speechiness'
* 'std_speechiness'
* 'mean_tempo'
* 'std_tempo'
* 'mean_valence'
* 'std_valence'
* 'mean_artistfollowers'
* 'std_artistfollowers'
* 'mean_artistpopularity'
* 'std_artistpopularity'
* 'genre1'
* 'genre2'
* 'genre3'

>here is a quote

Here is *emph* and **bold**.

Here is some inline math $\alpha = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}$ and, of-course, E rules:

$$ G_{\mu\nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu\nu}  = 8 \pi T_{\mu\nu} . $$
